    "# What is the main difference between the Euclidean distance metric and the Manhattan distance metric in KNN? How might this difference affect the performance of a KNN classifier or regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between Euclidean and Manhattan distance metrics lies in how they measure distance between two points. Euclidean distance is the straight-line distance between two points, while Manhattan distance is the sum of the absolute differences between the coordinates of the two points.\n",
    "This difference can affect KNN performance as Euclidean distance gives more weight to differences in magnitude, whereas Manhattan distance is more sensitive to differences in direction. For example, if features have different scales, Euclidean distance may be dominated by features with larger scales, while Manhattan distance may give a more balanced measure of distance."

    "The optimal value of k can be chosen through techniques such as cross-validation, grid search, or using domain knowledge.\n",
    "Cross-validation involves splitting the data into training and validation sets multiple times, trying different values of k, and selecting the one that gives the best performance on the validation set.\n",
    "Grid search involves systematically testing a range of k values and selecting the one with the best performance."

    "\n",
    "The choice of distance metric affects how the algorithm measures similarity between data points. Euclidean distance is suitable when features have a continuous distribution and are correlated, while Manhattan distance is more suitable when features are categorical or when the differences in magnitude are more important than the direction.\n",
    "The choice of distance metric should be made based on the characteristics of the data and the problem at hand."

    "Common hyperparameters in KNN include the value of k, the choice of distance metric, and the method of weighting neighbors.\n",
    "The value of k affects the bias-variance tradeoff; larger k values lead to smoother decision boundaries but may overlook local patterns.\n",

    "These drawbacks can be addressed by using dimensionality reduction techniques to reduce computational complexity, feature selection to remove irrelevant features, and techniques such as oversampling or undersampling to handle imbalanced datasets. Additionally, using distance-weighted KNN can help mitigate the impact of irrelevant features.\n",
